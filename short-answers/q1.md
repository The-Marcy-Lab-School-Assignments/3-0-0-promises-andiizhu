# Question

Consider the following code:

```js
Promise.resolve("Inside promise").then(console.log);
console.log("Outside promise");
```

Which prints first: `Inside promise` or `Outside promise`. More importantly, can you explain why?

# Answer

In this case `Outside promise` will be printed frint because it is synchronous. Then `Inside promise` will be printed because it is asynchronous. All synchronous code executes will before asynchronous code.
