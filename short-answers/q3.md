# Question

With `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, which of the following makes the promise produce a value?

a. calling `resolve()` or `reject()`

b. calling _and_ returning them

# Answer

The correct answer would be option a. Calling `resolve()` and `reject()` acts on the promise with the given output (value or error). `resolve()` and `reject()` do not need to be return because they are based on the promise state. `resolve()` represents the promise state of `fulfilled` and `reject()` represents the promise state of `rejected`.
