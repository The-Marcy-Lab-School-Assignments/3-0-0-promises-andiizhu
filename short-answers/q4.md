# Question

with `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, what do the arguments that you pass into `resolve/reject` do?

# Answer

The arguments that are passed into comes to a resolution. If the promise state is `fulfilled` then the argument inside of `resolve` is resolved as an output. If the promise state is `rejected` then the argument inisde of `reject` is resolve as an output. It is now up to `.then` and `.catch` to determine what is happening to the argument that was present in the `resolve` and `reject` methods.
