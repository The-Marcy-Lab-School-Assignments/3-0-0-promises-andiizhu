# Question

What is the difference between `.then` and `.catch`? What are the similarities?

# Answer

The differences between `.then` and `.catch` relate to the promise states `fulfilled` and `rejected`. When a promise is `fulfilled`, the code inside `.then` will be executed. When a promise is `rejected`, the code inside `.catch` will be executed. The similarity between `.then` and `.catch` is that they both consume and return the promise. Also, `.then` and `.catch` allows chaining.
